# freeCodeCamp | Product Landing Page

This is the third project of the Responsive Web Design course on Free Code Camp. The objective is to build a product landing page that is functionally similar to the original project on their website.

## Rules

- My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

- An image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

- Within the #header element I should see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

- Have at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

- When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

- Be able to watch an embedded product video with id="video".

- My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

- Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

- The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

- The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

- Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

- When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

- Should have at least one media query.

- Should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
